        <h1>Warthog</h1>
        <p>
          Phacochoerus is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, known as
          warthogs. It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae. They are
          found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid regions, in
          sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered
          conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but
          today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and
          most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog) is
          Phacochoerus africanus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear
          largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and
          the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The
          English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly
          distinct in males. They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a
          length of 25.5 to 63.5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in) in the males, but are
          always smaller in the females. They are largely herbivorous, but
          occasionally also eat small animal food. While both species remain
          fairly common and widespread, and therefore are considered to be of
          Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert
          warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around
          1865.
