        <h1>Giraffe</h1>
        <p>
          The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate
          mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
          ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its
          leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are
          its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its
          distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family
          Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The
          nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South
          Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the
          east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open
          woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they
          browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by
          leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not
          have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations
          if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males
          establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts
          where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access
          to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.
        </p>

          <h2>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h2>
        </strong>
        <p>
          You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.
