        <h1>Koala</h1>
        <p>
          The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]) is
          an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only
          extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest
          living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas
          of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland,
          New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily
          recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round,
          fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length
          of 60 to 85cm (24 to 33 in) and weighs 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb). Pelage
          colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the
          northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than
          their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are
          separate subspecies, but this is disputed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of
          these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has
          limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary
          and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding
          exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males
          communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract
          mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands
          located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to
          underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where
          they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These
          young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old.
          Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by
          various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala
          retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.
