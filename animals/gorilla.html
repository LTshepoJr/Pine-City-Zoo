        <h1>Gorilla</h1>
        <p>
          Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that
          inhabit the forests of central Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla is
          divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western
          gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest
          living primates by physical size. The DNA of gorillas is highly
          similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is
          counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans
          after the chimpanzees and bonobos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in
          Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa,
          gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla
          inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga
          Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to
          14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps
          and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living
          in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living
          in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
