        <h1>Lion</h1>
        <p>
          The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus
          Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term
          African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in
          Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the
          second-largest living cat after the tiger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an
          endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in
          India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa
          and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene,
          about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land
          mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia
          from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to
          Peru.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population
          decline in its African range of 30 to 50% per two decades during the
          second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable
          outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of
          the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
          humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa,
          the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
