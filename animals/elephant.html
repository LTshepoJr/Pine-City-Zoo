        <h1>Elephants</h1>
        <p>
          Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order
          Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African
          elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas
          maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South
          Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are the largest
          extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and
          weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
        </p>
        <p>
          All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of
          which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes,
          particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their
          incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for
          moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control
          their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great
          weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while
          Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats
          including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay
          near water.
        </p>
        <h2>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h2>
        <p>
          You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the
          amphitheatre.
